# BreastCancerPredict
This project aims to develop a predictive model for the early detection of breast cancer using logistics regression. The model is trained on a dataset containing features extracted from breast cancer biopsies, such as cell size, texture, smoothness, to classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
